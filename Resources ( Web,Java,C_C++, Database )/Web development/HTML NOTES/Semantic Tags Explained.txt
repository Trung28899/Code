What is Semantic html5 ? 
Semantic tag is the way to give meaning to data in the web page. For example, a text within
a <h1> tag is the header, a text with in <p> tag is the paragraph. In html, you can simply
type a text without giving it any meaning (tag) and it's still visible on the web page.
 
Why you should use semantic html5 ?

Two reason why you should use semantic html5 are: 
- It makes your code easier to maintain and configure
- It makes your web page more advantageous for searching 

	Making your code easier to maintain. HTML5 itsself can be very very freecoded,
which makes it confusing to read a large web page. A way to structure your html code in 
blocks would be a great help for later configuration. In semantic html5, there are predefined
structure that you'll have to follow, code have the same format and are coded in blocks
of tags. Therefore, it's easier to read and maintain.

	Bring more advantage for your page when it comes to searching. When the search 
engine reads a website, it leave out the style and read the plain html. Semantic tags help 
search engine to rank what content is more important in the web page. For example, a
sentence in <h1> tag is ranked higher than <p> tag when it comes to searching. Therefore,
the text in <p> tag will likely be ignored when it come to searching.
