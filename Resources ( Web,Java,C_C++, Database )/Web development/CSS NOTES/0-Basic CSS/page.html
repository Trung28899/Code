			<h1>Tesla and Elon Musk</h1>
			<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has clarified that a camera located above the Model 3’s rear-view mirror is there for when the car will eventually be able to work as an autonomous taxi. “It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft,” the CEO wrote on Twitter in response to someone raising privacy concerns about the camera. “In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video.” It could also augment the car’s Sentry Mode to keep an eye on pets and thieves.</p>
