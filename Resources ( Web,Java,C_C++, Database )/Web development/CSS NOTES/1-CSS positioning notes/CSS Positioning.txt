Css Positioning Theory: 

- Default position: static. 
This is when the page load and render the order of the html documentation
Howevers, sometimes you would want to relocate pieces of content or even 
change the order of pieces of content. To do so, you can use 3 position 
values: absolute, relative and fixed

- Some background info: 
+, When we add position property, we now can use 4 other properties
for postioning: top, bottom, left, right
+, When we positioning the pieces, keep in mind there is 2 things 
you should keep in mind: the position properties (top, bottom, left, right)
and where are these positioning refers to (positioning context).
+, Understand css positioning values is to understand where the positioning
refers to.

- absolute: 
+, Positioning context: positioning based on its parent. In order to be parent, 
the parent tag must also have position: absolute. If there is no parent mentioned
<html> will be its parents
+, The element with postion absolute will be removed from the document flow and 
repositioned based on the specified position based on its parent
+, example: 
position: absolute;
top: 10px; 
means move down 10px from the top of the parent

- relative: 
+, Positioning context: positioning based on its original position (or based on its 
static position)
+, example: 
position: relative; 
top: 10px; 
means move down 10px from its original position

- static: 
+, Positioning context: always refer to the viewport - <html>. 
+, It's not affected by scroll, if you scroll, the position remain the same
+, example: 
position: fixed; 
top: 20px; 
means move down 20px from the begin of the whole page

*, Bonus: z-index
+, When two elements are on top of each other, the one with higher value of z-index property
will be shown
+, z-index does not work with static position.
