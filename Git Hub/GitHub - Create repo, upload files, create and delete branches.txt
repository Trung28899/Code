CREATING REPO AND ADDING FILES FROM LOCAL FILES TO ONLINE REPO

create repo on github 
go to a file on your computer 
> open git bash (pre installed program)

$ git init > ???
$ git remote add randomName Link_of_Repo_on_github 
> this link the local file location to a repository on github
> Question: what is the random name for ??
$ git add .
> add all the files with in the local file to git repo
$ git status
> show the status of all the files
$ git push -u randomName master
> Creating user master ??

------------------------------------------------------
PULLING CODE FROM GITHUB: 

Choose a local folder
$ git clone repoLink
> the repo will be automatically cloned
and you can create branch, modify, upload files from here
automatically connected to github on the website
------------------------------------------------------

AT THIS POINT YOU SHOULD ABLE TO SEE ALL THE FILES ON 
GITHUB. NOW IF YOU CHANGE ANY CODE IN ANY OF THE FILES
TRY THE FOLLOWINGS: 

modify something in one of the files
$ git status > will see the modified file
$ git add filename > update the file
$ git status > the file should be uploaded
$ git commit -m "commit title that you want to put"
$ git push > push all the update to github

BONUS: you can do this with default branch which is master
or you can create a branch, switch to that branch name 
to operate under that branch name

------------------------------------------------------
CREATING BRANCHES: 

$ git checkout -b branchname > Create branch name
$ git checkout branchname > switch branch, operate under 
chosen branchname
$ git branch > show all the branch name
$ git push cprog branchname 
> push code under branchname

------------------------------------------------------
DELETING BRANCHES: 

$ git push randomName :branchName > Delete branch on github
$ git checkout master > change branch into master
$ git branch -d dev > delete dev branch on your computer 


QUESTION: 
- Differences between master branch and personal branch
> 2 different version flow ?
